# ðŸŒ± Level 1: The Basics â€“ What is MCP?

**ðŸ§  Imagine Talking to an AI**

When you chat with ChatGPT, your messages donâ€™t exist in isolation â€” it need context to understand what youâ€™re talking about. Thatâ€™s where **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** comes in.

**MCP = a way to define and manage the context that an AI model uses to respond to you.**

Itâ€™s kind of like:

* Setting the **scene** before a conversation
* Providing the **backstory, goals,** and **rules**
* Giving the model a memory of whatâ€™s relevant **in this session**

**ðŸ§ƒ Example (Simple)**
___

Letâ€™s say you're building an AI assistant for a coffee shop.

With MCP, you could tell the model:
```
SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS:
You are a helpful assistant for a local coffee shop. Be friendly and concise.

CONTEXT:
The user is a barista trying to manage daily orders and inventory.

GOALS:
Help the user track orders, suggest drinks, and restock supplies.
```
This is all part of the **Model Context Protocol** â€” it gives the AI a "head start" in knowing how to behave and what to care about.
